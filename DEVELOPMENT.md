# Applicant Portal - Development Notes

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic project structure created
- ✅ Angular frontend scaffolded
- ✅ .NET backend API created
- ✅ JSON file storage implemented
- ✅ Sample data added

## Next Steps (When you're ready to implement)

### Frontend Development
1. Install Angular dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `ng serve`
3. The lint errors you see are expected - they'll resolve once you install the npm packages

### Backend Development
1. Restore NuGet packages: `dotnet restore`
2. Run the API: `dotnet run`
3. Access Swagger UI at: `https://localhost:5001/swagger`

### Features to Implement
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - User registration/login
   - JWT tokens
   - Role-based access

2. **File Upload**
   - Resume upload functionality
   - File storage service
   - File validation

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Search and filtering
   - Pagination
   - Email notifications
   - Application analytics

4. **Database Migration**
   - Move from JSON to SQL Server/PostgreSQL
   - Entity Framework Core
   - Migrations and seeding

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for API
   - E2E tests for frontend

### Production Considerations
- Add proper error handling
- Implement logging (Serilog)
- Add application insights
- Configure for cloud deployment
- Add health checks
- Implement rate limiting
- Add input validation
- Security headers and HTTPS

## Architecture Notes
- Frontend follows Angular best practices with standalone components
- Backend uses clean architecture principles
- Dependency injection configured
- CORS enabled for development
- Swagger documentation included

## Folder Structure Details

### Frontend (/frontend)
- `src/app/components/` - Angular components
- `src/app/services/` - HTTP services
- `src/app/models/` - TypeScript interfaces
- `src/app/app.routes.ts` - Route configuration

### Backend (/backend)
- `Controllers/` - API controllers
- `Services/` - Business logic
- `Models/` - Data models and DTOs
- `Program.cs` - Application startup

### Database (/database)
- `applications.json` - JSON file storage
- This will be replaced with a real database later
